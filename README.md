# Clojure for the Brave and True

Pull requests
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com) are very
much welcome! I'll use them as errata reports. Please keep in mind
that the HTML was generated by Adobe InDesign or some such, so it's
pretty crappy - and that's OK. I'm not concerned with that; I *am*
concerned with inaccuracies in the content.

All the textual content's under `/content/cftbat`.

After installing ruby and bundler, build with

```
bundle
guard init nanoc
guard
```

Start a server at `localhost:3000` with `nanoc view`.
