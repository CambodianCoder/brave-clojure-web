# All the Java You Need

There comes a day in every Clojurist's life when she must venture
forth from the sanctuary of pure functions and immutable data
structures into the wild and barbaric land of Java. This treacherous
journey is necessary because Clojure, as a language *hosted* on the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it has two fundamental
characteristics. First, a Clojure application is a Java application
from an operations perspective (building, deploying, and running your
application). Second, you need to use Java objects to get a lot of
stuff done, like reading files and working with dates. In this way,
Clojure is a bit like a utopian community plunked down in the middle
of a decidedly non-utopian country. It's preferable to interact with
the other members of the community, but every once in awhile you need
to talk to the locals in order to get things done.
