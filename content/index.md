## A Starting Point for Great Documentation

Writing documentation is a skill, just like programming or riding a
bike or yodeling. If your project lacks great documentation, it's
likely for the same reason that it lacks groovy yodeling tunes. You
have no idea what's involved or where to begin.

That's where this site comes in. The site itself is built using
Doc Template ([git](https://github.com/flyingmachine/doctemplate)), an
open-source tool which lets you focus on your content while allowing
you to change the presentation easily. Of course,
[detailed documentation](docdocs) is included. There's also a
[quick start guide](quickstart) for the impatient.

The site also contains an evolving set of guidelines for writing good
documentation.

## General Guidelines for Great Documentation

Ther are many different kinds of documentation (architecture, API,
tutorials, etc) but all are meant to help users answer questions. As
such, the general guidelines for documentation are the same as for any
other reference material.

The below guidelines are a first draft. Please do send suggestions
through [issues](https://github.com/flyingmachine/doctemplate/issues),
[pull requests](https://github.com/flyingmachine/doctemplate/pulls),
or tweets to @nonrecursive.

More guidelines can be found in
[Jacob Kaplan-Moss's excellent guide](http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/).

1. Identify the questions your users will ask. Examples:
    * How do I extend this code?
    * How do I build this project?
    * What is the configuration variable for enabling caching?
2. Make it easy for users to find the content they need.
    * Organize your content logically
    * Support the organization with design
        * Clearly distinguish section headers for easy scanning
        * Use a readable font and choose readable, contrasting colors
        * For more on design, see
