# Introduction

*Clojure!* For weeks, months &ndash; no, from the very minute you were
born &ndash; you've felt it calling to you. Every time you've held
your keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible
class hierarchy; every time you've lain awake at night, disturbing
your loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every
time you've pulled out more of your ever-dwindling hair, some secret
part of you has known that *there has to be a better way*.
