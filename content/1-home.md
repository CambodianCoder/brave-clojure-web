# Make Great Documentation

Writing documentation is a skill, just like programming or riding a
bike or yodeling. If your project lacks great documentation, it's
likely for the same reason that it lacks groovy yodeling tunes. You
have no idea what's involved or where to begin.

That's where this site comes in. It gives you a starting point by
providing:

* A [tool](2-quickstart/) for creating documentation
* [Guidelines](3-writing-guidelines/) for writing documentation
* Examples of great documentation

## Links

### Examples of Great Documentation

* [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/), a ruby static site
  generator (which this site is built with)
* [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/), a python web
  framework
* [The stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api), the API for a payment
  processing service
* [docco.coffee](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/), a literate
  programming documentation generator
* [backbone.js API](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), API
  documentation for a javascript MVC framework
* [yardoc](http://yardoc.org/), the project page for a Ruby
  documentation tool

### Project Links
