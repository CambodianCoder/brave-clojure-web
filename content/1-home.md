# Make Great Documentation

Writing documentation is a skill, just like programming or riding a
bike or yodeling. If your project lacks great documentation, it's
likely for the same reason that it lacks groovy yodeling tunes. You
have no idea what's involved or where to begin.

That's where this site comes in. The site itself is built using
Doc Template ([git](https://github.com/flyingmachine/doctemplate)), an
open-source tool which lets you focus on your content while allowing
you to change the presentation easily. Of course,
[detailed documentation](docdocs) is included. There's also a
[quick start guide](quickstart) for the impatient.

The site also contains an evolving set of guidelines for writing good
documentation.
