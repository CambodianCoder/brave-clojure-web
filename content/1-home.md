# Pre-Introduction

**Hold up!** This is a work in progress! The only reason I even have
it online at all is so I can get feedback. If you'd like to send me
some, please do <a href="mailto:brave-clojure@googlegroups.com">email
the mailing list</a>! In the mean time, if you really are *brave* and
*true*, then continue reading!

# Introduction

\**Clojure!*\*

For weeks, months &mdash; no, from the very moment you were born
&mdash; you've felt it calling to you. Every time you've held your
keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class
hierarchy; every time you've lain awake at night, disturbing your
loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a
race condition has caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling
hair, some secret part of you has known that *there has to be a better
way*.

Now, at long last, the web-based instructional material you have in
front of your face will unite you with the programming language you've
been longing for. Over the course of these pages, you will learn:

**How to set up your computer for optimal learning.**<br /> In order
to learn Clojure it makes sense to invest a small amount of time up
front to get familiar with a quick, problem-free way to build and run
Clojure programs. We'll also go over how to experiment with code
within a running Clojure process using a REPL. The goal is to have a
quick feedback loop where you can try some code, see what it does, and
learn from the result.

**Using Emacs for Clojure development.**<br /> Having a quick feedback
loop for learning is so important that we cover Emacs from the ground
up so that you'll have an efficient Emacs/Clojure workflow. Pointers
to resources for other editors are also included.

TODO: explain the approach. Give some concrete things to do, then
explain the broader principles. Give enough to make it interesting,
then provide the skeleton needed to make sense of it all.
