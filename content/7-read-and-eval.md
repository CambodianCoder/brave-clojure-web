# Clojure Alchemy: Reading and Evaluation

As you well know, oh noble-faced reader, those who endeavor to be
*brave* and *true* must be well-versed in the chemical arts. 

The history of chemistry is fascinating. As alchemy, it lurched along
in fits and starts, inextricably tied to magic and mysticism. Chemical
reactions were proof of the supernatural. The philosopher's stone was
not just a wonder tool for transmuting base metals into gold; it was
also a metaphor for transcending the duality and reaching
enlightenment. Each chemical substance was its own force of nature,
with no rational relationship to other chemicals.

Until, finally, Dmitri Mendeleev developed the periodic table. After
millennia of confusion, scientists and philosophers could plainly see
the relationships among elements.

In the last chapter, we introduced magical elements like "form",
"special form", and "function call". In this chapter, you'll develop
the same understanding that the periodic table endows. By the end,
you'll be able to clearly see the relationships among Clojure's
component parts. We'll get you to this understanding by explaining
Clojure's fundamental mechanisms: reading and evaluation.

Once you understand these fundamentals, you'll be ready to wield
Clojure's philosopher's stone: the macro. With macros, you'll
transcend code/data duality to become the most powerful programmer
aliiiiiiiiive!
