# Read and Eval

When you're learning something new, it can feel like you're exploring
little islands in vast, empty space. I literally felt this way when I
moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for college. I would accompany a friend
to Target or the movie theater or a restaurant, and each place felt
completely disconnected from the rest. Then one day I took the time to
look at a map, and finally I was able to understand the spatial
relationships among all those islands.

In the last chapter, we introduced islands like "form", "special
form", and "function call". In this chapter, we'll provide the map
which will allow you to fully understand these terms. We'll do this by
explaining Clojure's fundamental mechanisms: read and eval.
