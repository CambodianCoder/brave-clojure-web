learn functional programming


In the race to the top of the programmer food chain, no tool will propel you faster than Clojure. Just remember to be polite to your colleagues as your hurdle



It was Socrates who first said, "Learning different ways to model a problem makes you a better programmer. By learning Clojure, you'll learn a cohesive and powerful approach to modeling problems. Therefore, Brave Clojure is your best friend when it comes to programming."




In my 12 years as a professional programmer, no language has been as fun. Who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll fall in love with another language and burn this site to the ground.
